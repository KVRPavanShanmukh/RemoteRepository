BRANCHING IN GIT:
Branching is a method of diverging from the main line of development and continuing to work independently without affecting that main line.
Each branch represents an independent line of development, allowing multiple tasks such as feature work, bug fixes, or experiments to proceed in parallel.
NOTE:
bname is branch's name

COMMANDS:

$git branch  				//shows active branches

$git branch -a 				//lists all the branches in active and removed repositories. red colored branches are already created and deleted

$git branch bname 			// creation of a branch

$git checkout bname 		//To switch directly to another branch and work.

$git checkout - b bname 	//Creates and  new branch and Switched to that new branch.(Similar to hotel room checkout)

$git branch -d bname 		//

$git
